Technologies Used:

1. HTML: For structuring the game interface.
2. CSS: For styling the game interface.
3. JavaScript: For game logic, user interaction, and dynamic updates.

How it Works:

1. The user selects their choice (rock, paper, or scissors) by clicking on the corresponding button.

Project Benefits:

1. Improves JavaScript skills: This project helps develop problem-solving skills and JavaScript programming concepts.
2. Enhances user experience: The game provides an interactive and engaging experience for users.
3. Builds game development skills: This project demonstrates basic game development concepts, such as game logic and user interaction.
