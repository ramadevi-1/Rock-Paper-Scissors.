Rock Paper Scissors Project

The Rock Paper Scissors project is a simple game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows users to play against the computer, making choices between rock, paper, or scissors.

Key Features:

1. User Interface: A user-friendly interface built with HTML and CSS, allowing users to select their choice (rock, paper, or scissors).
2. Computer Opponent: A JavaScript function generates a random choice for the computer opponent.
3. Game Logic: JavaScript code determines the winner based on the user's choice and the computer's choice.
4. Score Tracking: The game keeps track of the user's score and the computer's score.

Technologies Used:

1. HTML: For structuring the game interface.
2. CSS: For styling the game interface.
3. JavaScript: For game logic, user interaction, and dynamic updates.

How it Works:

1. The user selects their choice (rock, paper, or scissors) by clicking on the corresponding button.
2. The computer generates a random choice.
3. The game determines the winner based on the game's rules (rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, paper beats rock).
4. The game updates the score and displays the result.

Project Benefits:

1. Improves JavaScript skills: This project helps develop problem-solving skills and JavaScript programming concepts.
2. Enhances user experience: The game provides an interactive and engaging experience for users.
3. Builds game development skills: This project demonstrates basic game development concepts, such as game logic and user interaction.
